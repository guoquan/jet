# JET - Jupyter Enrolled Tunnel

This is a tool to redirect local hosted web applications to remote server via SSH.
It is originated from the need to export my Jupyter notebooks in my lab to somewhere I can access from the Internet.
[`autossh`](http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh) and some bash also do the job but it is difficult to manage my configuration when I have many resources to export.

If you need the config to pass the password, `sshpass` is required.
